# Tic-Tac-Toe Game

## Overview

This is a simple implementation of the classic Tic-Tac-Toe game using Python's Tkinter library. 
The game allows two players to take turns placing their respective symbols (X or O) on a 3x3 grid. The first player to successfully place three of their symbols in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row wins the game. 
If all spaces on the grid are filled and no player has won, the game ends in a tie.

## Game Rules

1. The game starts with two players, X and O.
2. Players take turns placing their symbols (X or O) on an empty cell of the 3x3 grid.
3. The first player to successfully place three of their symbols in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row wins the game.
4. If all cells on the grid are filled and no player has won, the game ends in a tie.
